## My process

- Start a react project
- Set up tailwindcss
- Code HTML
- Apply tailwindcss properties

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I had to revisit how to use flex and grid with tailwindcss before starting with project. I also had minor issues deploying with github pages but I managed to fix it after some troubleshooting.

### Useful resources
